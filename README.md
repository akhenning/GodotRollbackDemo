This is a basic demo PoC for a rollback online multiplayer game, with all basic features working, using Snopek Games' rollback and physics code. 

I will modify it to make a proper game, but that will be in a private repo. I wanted to keep this saved separately just in case.

Feel free to use this if you'd like, though I'm not sure I'd reccommend it. However, it definitely would be useful as reference for people trying
to figure out the rollback.
